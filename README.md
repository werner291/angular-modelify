# angular-modelify
A data-modeling library for Angular meant to make interaction with a REST api
easy while using a full client-side relational model, including models that have
cycles in them.

The library is strongly inspired by [angular-resmod by Platanus](https://github.com/platanus/angular-restmod) as
well as others.

This library is meant to be a full-fledged client-side datamodel that interacts
with a REST api, with as much automation. as possible.

This library is in a very early stage of development.
