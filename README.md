# angular-modelify
A data-modeling library for Angular meant to make interaction with a REST api easy while using a full client-side relational model,
including models that have cycles in them.

The library is strongly inspired by [angular-resmod by Platanus](https://github.com/platanus/angular-restmod).

There are other libraries to do this like angular-restmod or ngResource, but I foudn they were slightly lacking in certain aspects.

This library is meant to be a full-fledged client-side datamodel that interacts with a REST api, with as much as automation.

This library is in a very early stage of development.
