# angular-restmodel
A data-modeling library for Angular meant to make interaction with a REST api easy while using a full client-side relational model.

There are other libraries to do this like angular-restmod or ngResource, but I foudn they were slightly lacking in certain aspects.

This library is meant to be a full-fledged client-side datamodel that interacts with a REST api, with as much as automation.

This library is in a very early stage of development.
